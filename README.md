## Introduction

Application should contain list of bank transactions, based on design structure from _design.png_ file and contain following functionalities:

1.  Transactions fetched from API, displayed in table or list.
2.  Pagination (infinite-scroll or traditional, 20 items per page)
3.  Filtering by `beneficiary` field
4.  Form for adding new transaction to the list with basic non-empty fields validation. Add input fields for:
    -   amount (must be positive)
    -   account number (not empty, numbers)
    -   address
    -   description
    -   date and id should be generated when submiting form
5.  Simple communicate when success/error after form submission.

NOTE: Points 2-5 should be done on front-end side.
